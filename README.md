#### Python version: Python3 
#### IDE: Visual Studio Code 
In order to run the code provided by the authors of the paper, we had to install the following dependencies. 
We used Visual Studio Code to import the project into and then proceeded to install the required libraries
<br>
  `sudo pip3 install torch torchvision`
<br>
  `sudo pip3 install Cython`
<br>
  `sudo pip3 install torchsparseattn`

Once the dependencies are installed run the code by executing this
<br>
`python3 main.py`
